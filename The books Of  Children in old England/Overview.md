## Forewords, or General Preface

> "The naturall maister Aristotell saith that euery body be the course of nature is enclyned to here & se all that refressheth & quickeneth the spretys of man / wherfor I haue thus in this boke folowynge gathered together divers treatises touching the Manners & Meals of Englishmen in former days..."

This collection includes treatises like *John Russell's Boke of Nurture* and *Hugh Rhodes's Boke of Nurture*, along with shorter poems aimed at educating young people in proper behavior.

### Education in Early England

The preface discusses the education of the upper classes, noting the role of "Henxmen" (pages of honour) at court who were taught "urbanitie and nourture," languages, music, and martial arts.

Education happened in several settings:
1.  **Nobles' Houses:** Young nobles served in households of higher rank to learn manners and courtly skills.
2.  **Home and Private Tutors:** Tutors taught grammar and other subjects.
3.  **Universities:** Oxford and Cambridge were centers of learning, initially primarily for the poor but increasingly for the wealthy.
4.  **Foreign Universities:** Some students traveled to Paris, Montpellier, or Padua.
5.  **Monastic and Cathedral Schools:** Convents and cathedrals often educated local children.
6.  **Grammar Schools:** Schools like Winchester and Eton began to provide structured education.
