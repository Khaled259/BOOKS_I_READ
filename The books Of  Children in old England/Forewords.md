**Aristotle** once said that everyone is naturally inclined to listen to and see things that refresh and quicken the human spirit. ✨ For this reason, I have gathered various treatises regarding the **Manners & Meals of Englishmen** from former days. I have also added illustrations of men from the olden times—both dining and in bed 🛌—so that the home life of our forefathers might be made plain to my fellows, bringing some joy to their minds.

The collection consists of two main texts:
*   **John Russell's** *Boke of Nurture*
*   **Hugh Rhodes's** *Boke of Nurture*

I have also included shorter poems addressed to children of different backgrounds: those from noble families ("Yonkers of account"), merchants' sons, schoolboys, and generally anyone willing to take advice on how to mend their manners and live a healthy life. 🍎

### 👑 The King's Henchmen

The "Sweet Children" addressed in these poems can be compared to the **Henchmen** (young pages of honor) at King Edward IV's court. These young gentlemen were under the care of a **Master of Henchmen**, whose job was to teach them:
*   🐴 How to ride cleanly and surely.
*   ⚔️ How to joust and wear armor.
*   🗣️ Courtesy in words and deeds.
*   🥣 Proper table manners (eating and drinking).
*   🎶 Harp playing, piping, singing, and dancing.
*   🌍 Languages and virtuous behavior.

The Master would sit in the hall with them to watch their behavior. These boys were the sons of gentlemen and had their own servants. As they grew up, many became **Esquires**, helping to entertain the court with music or stories of old kings. Some reached even higher stations, like **Thomas Howard**, a former henchman who became the Duke of Norfolk and won the victory at Flodden Field. 🏆

### 🎓 Education in Early England

The social rank of these children opens up the topic of upper-class education in early times. Back then, manly exercises, courtesy, music, and carving meat 🍖 were often considered more important than Latin or Philosophy.

In old romances, characters like **King Horn** and **Chaucer’s Squire** were specifically trained in:
*   Carving before their fathers at the table.
*   Serving drinks. 🍷
*   Playing the harp.
*   Riding horses.

### 🏰 Noble Houses as Schools

The main places of education for the nobility were the houses of other nobles, specifically the **Chancellors**.

*   **Thomas Becket:** It is said that nobles sent their sons to serve him, and he trained them with honor. Even the King entrusted his heir to Becket. 🤝
*   **Bishop Longchamps:** In contrast, he treated noble sons like servants, making them look down at the ground and goading them if they looked up. 😔

### 🤕 Discipline and Severity

Historical records show that training was often harsh.
*   **Agnes Paston** (1457) sent a message to her son's master to "truly belash him" (whip him) if he did not amend his ways. She also beat her marriageable daughter once or twice a week, sometimes breaking her head. 🤕
*   **Lady Jane Grey:** She told the scholar Roger Ascham that her parents were extremely severe, pinching and threatening her if she didn't do everything perfectly. However, she loved her schoolmaster, Mr. Elmer, because he taught her gently and pleasantly. 📖

**Roger Ascham** strongly criticized the beating of students, arguing that "sharp" schoolmasters ruin a child's love for learning. He believed children should be taught with gentle allurements, just as young horses are trained. 🐎

### ✝️ A Final Note

When **Bishop Grosseteste** (who came from humble origins) was asked by King Henry III how he knew how to train the sons of nobles so well, he fearlessly replied:

*"I learned it in the house of Kings greater than the King of England—by studying the lives of David, Solomon, and others in the Bible."* 📖✨
