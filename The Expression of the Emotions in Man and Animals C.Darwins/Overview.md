## 📖 About This Book

This repository contains a digital archive of **Charles Darwin's** seminal work, *The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals*. Originally published in 1872, this text focuses on the biological aspects of emotional life. Darwin explores the genetically determined aspects of behavior, arguing that the physical expression of emotions in humans and animals serves as evidence of our evolutionary continuity.

## 🧬 The Three Chief Principles
Darwin bases his analysis on three major principles of expression, detailed in the first three chapters:

1.  **The Principle of Serviceable Associated Habits:** Complex actions are of direct or indirect service under certain states of the mind, in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations, desires, etc.; and whenever the same state of mind is induced, however feebly, there is a tendency through the force of habit and association for the same movements to be performed.
2.  **The Principle of Antithesis:** Certain states of the mind lead to certain habitual actions, which are of service, as under our first principle. Now when a directly opposite state of mind is induced, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to the performance of movements of a directly opposite nature, though these are of no use.
3.  **The Principle of Direct Action of the Excited Nervous System:** Variations in the nervous system act independently of the will, and largely independently of habit.
