### 1. He Lives on the 12th Floor
> There is a man who lives on the 12th floor of an apartment building. Each morning, he rides the elevator down to the lobby and leaves for work. When he returns home from work, he gets in the elevator, and, if somebody else was in the elevator or if it rained that day, he would travel straight up to his floor.
